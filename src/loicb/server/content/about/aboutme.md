## In short

👋🏻 Hi, I'm Loic Blanchard, a Staff Software Engineer based in Singapore with over 5 years of experience in building scalable software solutions. My expertise lies in designing and leading the development of high-quality software systems, primarily using the Functional Programming language **Clojure** and its ecosystem. I am currently leading the engineering team at [Flybot Pte Ltd](https://www.flybot.sg/).

## My journey

After I got my Master in CS at [🇫🇷 CPE Lyon](https://www.cpe.fr/en/), I started my career as a software engineer with at [🇸🇬 Flybot Pte Ltd](https://www.flybot.sg/) developing pure Game backend API solutions using the **Functional Programming** paradigm with **Clojure**. I then worked on porting our Clojure logic to the CLR using the [Magic Compiler](https://github.com/nasser/magic) that generates .NET assemblies from Clojure code and which is compatible with Unity, the frontend used for our games.

I also created the company's website using a Clojure(Script) **full-stack**, leveraging some of our CEO's open-source libraries to showcase our custom web stack. I also experimented with mobile app development demonstrating that we could reuse most of the ClojureScript frontend state management (Re-Frame) from the web app.

I then worked on a **event-driven** multi-recommender system to send personal challenges to our players. It uses `Kafka` for event streaming, `Datomic` for storage, `Prometheus/Grafana` for monitoring, and it is containerized. The **CI/CD** is done in `Gitlab`. The apps are deployed in `AWS EKS`.

Finally, I am currently working on a data aggregator using Red Planet Labs's [RAMA](https://redplanetlabs.com/learn-rama) platform which simplifies building distributed systems by providing a high-level, declarative framework that abstracts away the complexities of managing state, concurrency, and communication.

### Responsibilities:

- **Leading** software architecture design and project management, reporting directly to the CEO.
- **Conducting** technical interviews and **onboarding** new engineers.
- **Developing** scalable and robust backend systems using `Clojure`, `Kafka`, and `Datomic`.
- **Designing** mobile and web applications that share logic using `ClojureScript`, `Re-frame`, `Reagent (React)` and `Reagent React Native`.
- Building **Containerized** applications to enhance our gaming platforms.
- **Porting** Clojure backend logic to .NET to allow Clojure backend APIs to be used in Unity.
