## Automation of AWS resources creation

For my end-of-study project (6 months internship as engineer to get the master degree), I automated the deployment of AWS resources for a trend detection diagnostic of damaged car parts project. I used CloudFormation to automate the deployment of the different environments. This allowed us to setup a full demo environment with anonymous data for a client showcase for instance (VPC, subnets, routers, DBs clusters, app etc) in just a few clicks and a few minutes.
To start the creation of AWS resources, we use Jenkins jobs so the team just had to pass a few parameters to setup everything.

## Use Agile Framework Scrum

We were a team of 8 and were following Agile development using the Atlassian suite (Jira Kanban, SourceTree and Bitbucket notably). Regarding the agile framework, we used Scrum.
