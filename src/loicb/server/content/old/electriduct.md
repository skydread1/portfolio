# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Software Developer Intern | Electriduct | Fort Lauderdale, USA

## Website design

I spent a year at Electriduct as a Developer intern in the middle on my master so I could graduate with already one year of experience.
I improved the design of their website using basic web languages. The new design was praised by customers and increased sales. I touched on some google advertising and analytics tools to create ad campaigns to boost sales as well.

## Inventory Management System development

I developed an inventory management program using UPC barcode reading which I did not see in production as I my internship ended but it was almost ready and the next intern took over after I left. I used PHP with no framework for that.

## Custom barcode generator development

I also created a customized barcode generator for either normal printers or thermal printer in C# and with SQL to connect to the inventory DB.
