# Flybot: Clojure Mobile APP (2023)

## Rational

The goal is to have a mobile app targeting both iOS and Android, written in ClojureScript, which can reuse most of our web frontend logic.

To do so, I used React Native for the following reasons:

- Integrate very well with [bhauman/figwheel-main](https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-main) and [day8/re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame)
- Target both iOS and Android
- Does not necessitate too much configuration to get it running
- React Native has an overall good documentation

## Repo

You can have a look at the code on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/skydread1/flybot.sg)

We use a mono repo structure where the `server` (clj files), and `client` (cljs files) reside alongside each others.
A `common` (cljc files) top folder is also used for data validation that applies for both server and client.

We actually have 2 clients: web and mobile.
So the mobile app frontend reside in the same repo as the web frontend and the 2 shares most of the re-frame events.

The mono-repo structure is as followed:

```clojure
├── client
│   ├── common
│   │   ├── src
│   │   │   └── flybot.client.common
│   │   └── test
│   │       └── flybot.client.common
│   ├── mobile
│   │   ├── src
│   │   │   └── flybot.client.mobile
│   │   └── test
│   │       └── flybot.client.mobile
│   └── web
│       ├── src
│       │   └── flybot.client.web
│       └── test
│           └── flybot.client.web
├── common
│   ├── src
│   │   └── flybot.common
│   └── test
│       └── flybot.common
├── server
│   ├── src
│   │   └── flybot.server
│   └── test
│       └── flybot.server
```
## Stack

The backend is the same as for the web app.

The mobile frontend is very similar as the web frontend.

The main differences with the web front end are the following:
- navigation: Tab and Stack Navigators for mobile instead of reitit.frontend.easy for web
- markdown support: convert markdown to native components instead of react components for the web
- cookie management: I manually store the cookie in AsyncStorage and manually pass it to the request

For the rest, most re-frame events remain the same between the 2 frontends, hence most of the re-frame logic is done in the client.common namespace.

## Hot reloading

[figwheel-main](https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-main) also works on mobile after a few setup steps required to get a react native app ready. To install the different native libraries, I just use npm. Once again, Figwheel is really convenient to use and provide clear configurations to get the hot reloading working.

## CI/CD

I tested the app on iOS only via the iOS Simulator in Xcode locally.
The app has not been deployed on any Store yet.
